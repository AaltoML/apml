title: Invitation to present at the Aalto Seminar on Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning


Dear xxx,

We (Arno Solin and Martin Trapp) are at the beginning of organising a series of invited talks at the ML group at Aalto University. The seminar series aims to provide a platform for young researchers (PhD or post-doc level) to give invited talks about their research, intending to have a diverse set of talks & speakers on topics related to probabilistic machine learning. 

To start with a set of exciting talks, we would like to invite you for a virtual talk (~30 min + 15 min Q&A).

The talks will be scheduled on Wednesday (every other week), 3 pm (Finnish time), and depending on your timezone, we will adjust your presentation time if needed. We will make all talks open to the public (upon registration), except if you prefer to have a private presentation. The talks will not be recorded in order to ensure that less polished/unfinished ideas can also be covered.

After the talk, we plan to have an open-end private discussion with you and the group to get to know each other better and have some further discussions.

To ensure many people can join your talk, we would start the seminar after the summer. 

If you are interested in giving a talk at our new seminar, please select the date that fits your schedule the best: https://doodle.com/poll/5qpy47vn4s3842ix?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link. We will then contact you for further details regarding a title for your talk, an abstract, and a short bio.

We are looking forward to hearing about your research and have some exciting discussions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

All the best

Arno Solin,
Martin Trapp

Message to direct invitees:

```
Dear everyone,
We cordially invite you and your group to attend our newly founded seminar on Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning.

The seminar series aims to provide a platform for young researchers across the global ML community to give invited talks about their research, intending to have a diverse set of talks & speakers on topics related to probabilistic machine learning. The presentations are virtual talks (~30 min + 15 min Q&A) given live over Zoom. 

You can find the list of upcoming talks and the registration form for the seminar on our website: https://aaltoml.github.io/apml. Please consider sharing this information with your group and colleagues.

We are excited that the first talk of our seminar will be by Will Tebbutt from the University of Cambridge on August 18, 2021, at 3 pm EEST.

Title: Combining Pseudo-Point and State Space Approximations for Sum-Separable Gaussian Processes

Abstract: State space approximations and pseudo point approximations can be combined in a principled manner to yield scalable approximate inference algorithms for sums of separable Gaussian processes. In this talk, I will: 1. show how this combination can be performed for variational pseudo point approximations via a simple conditional independence result, 2. discuss how existing exact inference algorithms for state space models can be re-purposed for approximate inference, 3. interpret existing related work in light of our work, and 4. briefly discuss some experimental results in a spatio-temporal context. For more info, please see our recent UAI paper.

About the presenter: Will Tebbutt is a PhD student with Rich Turner in the Machine Learning Group at Cambridge, and is interested in probabilistic modelling in general. He is particularly interested in Gaussian processes: how to specify and scale them in large spatio-temporal settings, how best to write software to work with them, and challenges faced in climate science for which they might be helpful.

Looking forward seeing you at our seminar,
Arno Solin & Martin Trapp
