# Invitation e-Mail

```
subject: Invitation to present at the ELLIS seminar on Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning (APML) 

Dear xxx,

We want to invite you for a talk (via Zoom, ~30 min + ~20 min Q&A) at the ELLIS seminar on Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning (APML) in fall 2022, starting in mid-September / October! 

The APML seminar aims to provide a platform for early-career researchers to present and discuss their research about probabilistic machine learning. Each talk will be scheduled on Thursday (every other week), 3 pm (Finnish time), and depending on your timezone, we will adjust your presentation time if needed. We will make all talks open to the public (upon registration), and the talks will not be recorded. After the talk, we have an informal open-end private discussion through a virtual lab visit, in the vain of going for drinks, to get to know each other better and have some further discussions. For details on the seminar series see: https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/

Please reply with a short "accept" if you are interested in giving a talk. If so, we will contact you for further details regarding the time of your talk, title, abstract, and short bio in due time.

We look forward to hearing about your research and having some exciting discussions about your research. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

All the best,
Martin Trapp & Arno Solin

# List of direct contacts

Message to direct invitees:

```
Dear everyone,
We cordially invite you and your group to attend our newly founded seminar on Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning.

The seminar series aims to provide a platform for young researchers across the global ML community to give invited talks about their research, intending to have a diverse set of talks & speakers on topics related to probabilistic machine learning. The presentations are virtual talks (~30 min + 15 min Q&A) given live over Zoom. 

You can find the list of upcoming talks and the registration form for the seminar on our website: https://aaltoml.github.io/apml. Please consider sharing this information with your group and colleagues.

We are excited that the first talk of our seminar will be by Will Tebbutt from the University of Cambridge on August 18, 2021, at 3 pm EEST.

Title: Combining Pseudo-Point and State Space Approximations for Sum-Separable Gaussian Processes

Abstract: State space approximations and pseudo point approximations can be combined in a principled manner to yield scalable approximate inference algorithms for sums of separable Gaussian processes. In this talk, I will: 1. show how this combination can be performed for variational pseudo point approximations via a simple conditional independence result, 2. discuss how existing exact inference algorithms for state space models can be re-purposed for approximate inference, 3. interpret existing related work in light of our work, and 4. briefly discuss some experimental results in a spatio-temporal context. For more info, please see our recent UAI paper.

About the presenter: Will Tebbutt is a PhD student with Rich Turner in the Machine Learning Group at Cambridge, and is interested in probabilistic modelling in general. He is particularly interested in Gaussian processes: how to specify and scale them in large spatio-temporal settings, how best to write software to work with them, and challenges faced in climate science for which they might be helpful.

Looking forward seeing you at our seminar,
Arno Solin & Martin Trapp
